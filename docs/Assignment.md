# 🎵 Take-Home Assignment - Senior Frontend Engineer

## Welcome to EVEN! 🎉

Thank you for your interest in joining our team. This assignment is designed to give you
creative freedom while allowing you to demonstrate your technical skills and approach to
modern development.
⏱ **Time expectation:** 4-6 hours
📅 **Due date:** 7 days from receipt

# 🎯 The Challenge

Build a **Music Artist Dashboard** feature that showcases your skills in Next.js, React, and
modern development practices.

## Core Requirements

You'll create a dashboard that displays:

1. **Recent Releases** - A list/grid of music releases
2. **Sales Analytics** - Visual representation of sales data
3. **Fan Engagement** - Some form of fan interaction metrics

## Creative Freedom 🎨

**You decide:**
● The exact features and functionality (within the core requirements)
● The design and user experience
● What metrics and data to show
● The visual style and interactions
● Any additional features that showcase your skills
We want to see YOUR interpretation of what makes a great artist dashboard.

# 📋 Technical Requirements

## Must Have

```
● ✅ Built with Next.js 14+ (App Router)
● ✅ Uses TypeScript
● ✅ Responsive design (mobile and desktop)
● ✅ At least one interactive data visualization (chart/graph)
● ✅ Mock data is fine (no need for real APIs)
● ✅ Clean, readable code with good structure
```

## Nice to Have (Choose what resonates with you)

```
● Tailwind CSS
● Component library (shadcn/ui preferred)
● State management (if needed)
● Testing (unit, integration, or E2E)
● Animations or micro-interactions
● Error handling and loading states
● Accessibility considerations
```

# 🤖 AI-Assisted Development - Required Section

⚠ This is important: We actively encourage and expect the use of AI tools in modern
development.

## What We Want to See

Along with your code, please provide a document (Markdown, PDF, or in your README) that
includes:

```
None
```

## 1. AI Tools Usage Log

Document your AI interaction throughout the project:
**Template for each significant AI interaction:**

1. ## [Feature/Task Name]
2.
3. **Goal:** What were you trying to accomplish?
4.
5. **AI Tool Used:** (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor)
6.
7. **Prompt/Approach:**
8. - What did you ask?
9. - How did you frame the problem?
10.
11. **Result:**
12. - What did the AI provide?
13. - Did you use it as-is or modify it?
14. - Why did you make those choices?
15.
16. **Learning:**
17. - What did you learn from this interaction?
18. - Would you do anything differently?
19.

## 2. Reflection Questions (Answer these)

**a) AI Strategy:**
● How did you decide when to use AI vs. code from scratch?
● Were there any tasks where AI wasn't helpful? Why?

**b) Code Ownership:**
● How did you ensure you understood all AI-generated code?
● Describe one piece of AI-generated code you significantly modified and why.
**c) Productivity Impact:**
● Estimate how much time AI saved you (or didn't).
● What would you have done differently without AI tools?
**d) Quality Assurance:**
● How did you validate AI-generated code?
● Did you catch any issues or mistakes from AI suggestions?

## 3. One Detailed Example

Pick ONE significant feature/component and do a deep dive:
● Show the initial prompt
● Show the iterations (if any)
● Explain your thought process
● Include code snippets showing before/after if you modified AI output
● Reflect on the quality of the AI's help

## Why We Ask For This

We want to understand:
● ✅ Your comfort level with AI tools
● ✅ Your critical thinking when using AI
● ✅ How you verify and validate AI output
● ✅ Your ability to learn and adapt AI suggestions
● ✅ Your honesty about the development process
Note: Using AI heavily is NOT a negative. We want to see strategic, thoughtful
usage.

# 📦 Deliverables

Please submit:

## 1. 💻 GitHub Repository (public or private - give us access)

```
● Clean, organized code
● Clear commit history (doesn't need to be perfect, but should tell a story)
```

## 2. 📄 README.md that includes:

```
● How to run the project locally
● Technology choices and why you made them
● Any assumptions you made
● Features you implemented
● What you'd do with more time
```

## 3. 🤖 AI Usage Documentation (can be in README or separate file)

```
● Your AI tools usage log
● Answers to reflection questions
● One detailed example
```

## 4. 🌐 Live Demo

```
● Deploy to Vercel/Netlify/similar
● Makes it easier for us to review!
```

# 🎨 Design Guidance

**You don't need to be a designer!** We're evaluating your:
● Code quality and architecture
● Problem-solving approach
● Use of modern React/Next.js patterns
● AI collaboration skills
**Design tips:**
● Use a component library if you want (shadcn/ui is great)
● Clean and functional > fancy and broken
● Focus on good UX patterns over pixel-perfect design
● Consistency matters more than creativity in design

# 💡 Tips for Success

## Do's ✅

```
● Start simple, then add complexity - Get core features working first
● Show your thinking - Code comments, git commits, documentation
● Be creative - Surprise us with something unique
● Use AI strategically - Document your process well
● Ask questions - Email us if anything is unclear (shows communication skills)
● Have fun - This should be enjoyable!
```

## Don'ts ❌

```
● Don't spend more than 6 hours on implementation (we can extrapolate from what you
build)
● Don't try to build everything - depth over breadth
● Don't hide AI usage - we want to see it!
● Don't copy tutorials - show us YOUR thinking
● Don't stress about perfection - we're looking for strong foundations
```

# 📊 Evaluation Criteria

# 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use libraries/frameworks beyond what's required?**
A: Yes! Choose what you're comfortable with and can justify.
**Q: What if I don't finish everything in 6 hours?**
A: That's expected! Document what you'd do with more time. We value quality over quantity.
**Q: Should I write tests?**
A: Only if time permits. We'd rather see one well-built feature than multiple half-done features.
**Q: Can I use an existing project as a starting point?**
A: Please start fresh. We want to see your approach from scratch.
**Q: What kind of data should I use?**
A: Mock data is fine. Be creative! You can use AI to generate realistic mock data.
**Q: How detailed should the AI documentation be?**
A: Quality over quantity. 3-5 good examples with thoughtful reflection is better than 20
superficial logs.
**Q: Can I use Cursor/Copilot's inline suggestions without documenting each one?**
A: Yes! Document significant AI interactions (like asking for help with a complex component),
not autocomplete suggestions. Use your judgment.
**Q: What if AI gave me bad suggestions?**
A: PERFECT! Document that. We want to see your critical thinking.
